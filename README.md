**Douyin Video Downloader Script**

**Description**

This Python script automates the process of scraping Douyin video links from a user's profile and downloading them using the Snaptik service. It leverages Selenium for web browser automation and provides some error handling to improve robustness.

**Requirements**

- Python 3.x
- Selenium (`pip install selenium`)
- webdriver_manager (`pip install webdriver_manager`)
- A compatible Chromium-based web browser (e.g., Chrome)

**Installation**

1. Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install selenium webdriver_manager
   ```

2. Download the appropriate ChromeDriver for your browser version from [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) and place it in a directory accessible by your system path or project directory.

**Usage**

1. **Configure Paths:**

   - Modify the script to set the following paths as needed:
     - `path_to_profile_chrome`: Path to your Chrome profile directory (if not using default)
**     -    How to take the profile_path:
**     -    go to chrome://version/ on your Chrome browser, you will see the profile path field

     

2. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python douyin_crawler.py
   ```
In the main(), configure those variables:
douyin_user_link: pass in the link to douyin profile
x: get the top x% most viewed videos on that profile

**Notes**

- This script interacts with external websites (Douyin, Snaptik) that may change their structure or behavior over time. You might need to adjust the code accordingly if these websites update their layouts.
- Consider potential terms of service or usage limitations on Douyin and Snaptik.
- Be responsible when downloading content and ensure you have the necessary rights or permissions.
